## Projects

### [EmbedLink](https://github.com/Berkin99/EmbedLink)
EmbedLink facilitates serial communication on STM32 in a manner compatible with RTOS. It processes raw data from built-in sensor and GPS libraries, generating kinematic data such as position and speed in the background.

### [EmbedBoot](https://github.com/Berkin99/EmbedBoot)
EmbedLink Secure Bootloader Application for Wireless Firmware Update.

### [AutoProgram](https://github.com/Berkin99/AutoProgram)
Autoprogram allows you to select the best combination of numerous and overlapping events for a week. Useful for university course selection, workout programs, and organized event management.

### [NorthstarLib](https://github.com/Berkin99/NorthstarLib)
Northstar radio protocol is optimized for low-level communication and debugging. It communicates with target computers like a debugger, handling interactions with tags representing variable or function addresses.

### [E32-TTL-100](https://github.com/Berkin99/E32-TTL-100)
E-Byte E32-TTL-100 Unofficial Module Driver based on Semtech SX1278 chip. Provides object-oriented, embedded system optimization.

### [MS5611](https://github.com/Berkin99/MS5611)
A platform-independent C API for the TE Connectivity MS5611 sensor. Supports SPI/I2C communication, calibration, and raw data transformation.

### [MPU6500](https://github.com/Berkin99/MPU6500)
Platform-independent C driver for the TDK InvenSense MPU6500 6-axis accelerometer and gyroscope sensor. Supports SPI and I2C communication interfaces, calibration, and provides access to raw and processed data.
